# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains all my solutions that I found for the Advent of Code 2022.

You can find the puzzles each year at https://adventofcode.com/

I recommend to not look at the solutions and try the puzzles yourself first.
I've created a special folder with just the puzzles of each day,
alongside the inputs for each day in the "inputs" directory.

**important**: The answers are hidden in the puzzles using `<details`  section.
Please read these through GitHub to not spoil the answer.

Happy Coding
